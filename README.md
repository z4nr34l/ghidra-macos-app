## Ghidra macOS Application

Download the latest application as `.dmg` file in releases section or just click [here to see latest release](https://github.com/z4nr34l/ghidra-macos-app/releases/latest) or [here to download latest application](https://github.com/z4nr34l/ghidra-macos-app/releases/download/10.1.5/Application.dmg).

Package features JDK 18 and [Ghidra 10.1.5](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).

I had made updated app wrapper for better user experience on macOS.

Just drag&drop `Ghidra` application to `Applications` directory and you're good to go.
