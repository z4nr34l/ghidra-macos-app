## Ghidra macOS Application

Download the latest application as `.dmg` file in releases section.

Package features `JDK 18` and `Ghidra 10.1.5`.

I had made updated app wrapper for better user experience on macOS.

Just drag&drop `Ghidra` application to Applications directory and you're good to go.
